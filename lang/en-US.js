    intro: `When Michele was born, Ornella Vanoni ranked second at the San Remo Festival, the core of our galaxy was discovered and Italy won gold in the diving category. When Elisa was born, the revolutionary Sixties were now a distant memory and the legacy of the Boomers was slowly discovering its cards. Retrospettivi is the fusion of two personalities whose mantra is "all you need is less" and, the music, the gravitational force that animates them. Optics boutique inspired by the hype of metropolitan style without forgetting the craftsmanship of the products.

Get dressed to visit one of the most eclectic shops in Portogruaro.
Enjoy!`,
